# Project 5: MineWalker

* Colby Allen
* Class: CS121-2
* Semester: Spring 2018

## Overview
This project allows the user to play a game of walking past mines, by using clues that the game gives you in order to avoid them.
You get 5 lives, try to take the least amount of steps for the highest score!

## Compiling and Using
To run this code, all you must do is compile by entering the command

$ javac MineWalker.java

And then once it has compiled (It might yell at you for not using a java API for the sound effects present),
enter this command;

$ java MineWalker

This will then put you into the game, exit out of the window when you are done!


## Discussions
Some of the biggest problems I had in making this project, were converting my point arraylists into something that my
tiles[x][y] could understand, but with help from Professor Schmidt, this was made very helpful.  Also, I could not understant why
my scores/lives were not updating as they would deplete, it took me a lot of Googling before I found out that they had to be in an
actionlistener, so that they would keep updating every move.  I never fully implemented the logic for putting the current tile back onto
the previous one after hitting a mine, so it is possible for the player to move on from a mine, instead of having to go around.  Fortunately,
once a mine has been hit and you leave it, it is impossible to click on the mine again.  I understand that I will lose points for this, but
 I am hoping that the extra credit with I did with the sound effects will help to keep me afloat in the A-range.  Going through the process
 of the labs forcing us to work on our projects was incredibly handy and made it seem like anything was possible in this project, and very
 necessary.  The research that I did on my own (website links will be pasted down below) included putting sounds within programs, as well as
 making pop up menus appear.  Some errors that I got when I finally uploaded everything onto MobaXTerm was that the program could for some
 reason not find the audio files it is supposed to be playing, but it worked on my laptop (effectively annoying my wife to death) so I hope
 that it works for you Professor Schmidt.  In this project, I finally felt that I could understand what the people on StackOverload would 
 talk about, and from that, I feel like I could program anything in the world if I wanted to, because all of the information you need is 
 out there somewhere, this feeling was very liberating.  
 
 
 ## Testing
 I tested my code by running it seemingly every two seconds after I would implement any new methods, just to see if it still worked and if
 what I attempted to do was successfull.  I ran it on my home computer (programming it on eclipse here) and then running it via MobaXTerm online,
 it ran over the internet (if quite slow) and I kept getting error messages that java could not find my audio files, but they are right outside
 of the src folder where the other components of the program are, so I do not know why that happened.  Everything else is peachy though.
 
 
 ## Extra Credit
 I completed the extra credit for including sound effects!!
 The sound effects are unique for these four events;
 
 Moving tiles, stepping on a mine, losing all lives, and finishing the game
 
 All sounds are guarenteed to make anyone laugh with glee all the way home.
